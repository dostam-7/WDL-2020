LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is online library system from which each of us can learn anywhere in World. It was one of big step towards tackeling the current pendamic situation. Due to current pendamic situation most of the collages library just become a warehouse of books, as the students can't came to Library and physically borrow books and learn from it. so for such condition we have decided to develop a system from which each student can learn any books by just typing its name in the custom search bar.
Apart from this we will also provide some additional information to students which will make the learning process easier
